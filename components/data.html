    <p align="justify" class="data-viz__text-desc">The above image shows the estimated amount of data created on internet in one minute. Myriads of downloads and uploads, posts and searches, messages sent and received, listens and streams happen every minute on the world wide web. It is Quantitative Data. According to data compiled by Lori Lewis and published on the site AllAccess, 60 seconds on the web in 2021 consist of more than 500 hours of content uploaded on YouTube, 695,000 stories shared on Instagram and nearly 70 million messages sent via WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. That same internet minute also contains more than two million swipes on Tinder as well as an incredible 1.6 million U.S. dollars spent online.</p>
